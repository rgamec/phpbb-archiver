## Introduction
Collection of tools for extracting and archiving ("scraping") phpBB forums. It's important to be able to preserve the cultural history of the Internet's communities and these tools go some way in providing the tools to do this. For various reasons it is sometimes not possible to export an SQL database backup directly from a phpBB forum, and so these tools allow anyone to scrape all the *publicly-accessible* post data from a forum and preserve it in their own locally hosted MySQL database.

## Usage
* For the time being you are likely to find phpbb_archiver script the most useful and usable.
* *Coming soon*

## Todo
* Better documentation.
* More thorough testing with a greater variety of phpBB installation types.
* Internationalization/localisation (i.e. support for phpBB installations in other languages)
* Commit my JSON API implementation for the post database.
